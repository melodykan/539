      Hi! I'm Melody.
      Iâ€™m currently a second-year Master's student studying Human-computer Interaction at the University of Michigan, specializing in User Experience Research and Design. As a multidisciplinary UX designer with a unique background in psychology and programming, I design with both empathy to users, as well as conceptual back-end knowledge of the products.<br><br>
      
      I leverage my professional skills at School of Information through a wide range of graduate courses.I believe interdisciplinary learning enables a UX designer to solve problems with multiple perspectives, thus creating better products with creativity and innovation.<br><br>
      
      Although I would not call myself an artist, I do have a life-long passion for art, whether appreciating or creating. I painted during high school, making artwork ranging from sketches to watercolor or even oil paintings.  Currently, I focus on digital design, such as interaction design, user interface design, AR/VR design. Regardless of what the media is, I enjoy and value aesthetic visual design while creating products with UX methodologies.
